# neighbors_school_choice

This study investigates how neighborhood peer effects influence school choice decisions, using administrative data from Chile's centralized school admission system (2020-2022). By linking each applicant to their nearest neighbor who applied to the same grade the previous year and to their census tract, we examine whether school choices exhibit patterns of simple or complex contagion, as theorized by recent social contagion literature. Drawing from geocoded data of three full applicant cohorts, we analyze how proximity and socioeconomic similarity affect shared school preferences. Using logistic regression models with neighborhood fixed effects, we explore whether students choose the same schools as their neighbors and how this influence varies by socioeconomic status and school level. The results have important implications for understanding how geographically embedded social interactions influence school choice decisions and potentially contribute to school segregation patterns, with implications for educational policy design and social inequality.
